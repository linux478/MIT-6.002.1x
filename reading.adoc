## 1.1 Power of Abstraction

$F = m \times a$

This simple force abstraction allows us to disregard many properties of objects such as their size, shape, density, and temperature, that are immaterial to the calculation of the objects acceleration.

The set of abstractions that transition from science to engineering and insulate the engineer from scientific minutiae are often derived through the discretization discipline.

Discretization is also referred to as lumping.

The discipline of discretization states that we choose to deal with discrete elements or ranges and ascribe a single value to each discrete element or range.

## 1.2 The Lumped Circuit Abstraction

$R = \frac{V}{L}$

$I = \frac{V}{R}$

The ratio is a constant (called the resistance R) only for lumped elements that obey Ohm's law.

The lumped circuit abstraction - Capped a set of lumped elements that obey the lumped matter discipline using ideal wires to form an assembly that performs a specific function results in the lumped circuit abstraction.

## 1.3 The Lumped Matter Discipline

The voltage, the current, and the resistance are defined for an element only under certain constraints that we collectively call the lumped matter discipline (LMD).

$V = I \times R$

Defining a current through the element means that the current in must equal the current out.
Therefore the current is constant and does not change.
